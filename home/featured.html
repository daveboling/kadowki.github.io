Prove it.</div><div class="weblinks"> <a href="http://knipit.daviddboling.com" target="blank">Live Demo</a><a href="http://www.github.com/kadowki/knipit" target="blank">Github Repository</a></div><p class="backdrop">Capstone Project #1</p><p class="backdrop">A no-nonense learning utility that encourages good form and gives the ability for others to challenge those with similar knowledge.
As a life-long learner, it is my belief that forming good study habits early will lead to a much deeper understanding of any subject. 
Knipit is an attempt to not only build upon already existing tools, but to also create challenges for students while
encrouaging good form at the same time. Knipit provides a chance for users to really prove
what they know and not only will that user prove it to someone else, but they will also prove it to themselves.</p></div><div class="photo"><a href="assets/images/knipit/s1.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/images/knipit/s1.png" class="photoItem"/></a><a href="assets/images/knipit/s2.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/images/knipit/s2.png" class="photoItem"/></a><a href="assets/images/knipit/s3.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/images/knipit/s3.png" class="photoItem"/></a><a href="assets/images/knipit/s4.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/images/knipit/s4.png" class="photoItem"/></a><a href="assets/images/knipit/s5.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/images/knipit/s5.png" class="photoItem"/></a></div></div></div><div class="featureTwo row"><div class="col-xs-12 shroud"><div class="description"><div class="title">Gravity Flip</div><p>After a trip through the Milky Way, your crew is ready to return to Earth.
