          p Know it. Prove it?

          p A no-nonense learning utility that encourages good form and gives the ability for others to challenge those with similar knowledge.
          | As a life-long learner, it is my belief that forming good study habits early will lead to a much deeper understanding of any subject. 
          | Knipit is an attempt to not only build upon already existing tools, but to also create challenges for students while
          | encrouaging good form at the same time. Knipit provides a chance for users to really prove
          | what they know and not only will that user prove it to someone else, but they will also prove it to themselves.
